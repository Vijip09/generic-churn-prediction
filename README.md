 # Churn Prediction System

## Overview

The Churn Prediction System is a flexible and robust machine learning solution designed to predict customer churn across various datasets. The project focuses on building a scalable machine learning pipeline, incorporating model explainability techniques, and creating a FastAPI backend for real-time predictions.

## Objective

Develop a system that:
- Predicts customer churn based on multiple datasets.
- Provides insights into model decisions using interpretability techniques.
- Simulates real-world deployment through a FastAPI backend.

## Datasets

The project utilizes multiple churn prediction datasets, including `telecom_churn.csv`. Each dataset may contain different features, but the target variable (churn) remains consistent.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd churn-prediction
